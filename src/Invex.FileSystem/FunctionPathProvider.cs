/// <remarks>
///     Use <see cref="FunctionPathProvider" /> (or the <c>ProvidePath</c> extension in
///     <see cref="FileSystemHostExtensions" />) when path logic is simple enough to express inline
///     rather than in a separate class.  For complex resolution logic — such as searching the file
///     system or combining multiple keys — a dedicated <see cref="IPathProvider" /> implementation
///     is clearer.
