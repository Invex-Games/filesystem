/// <summary>
///     Provides extension methods for fluently chaining additional transformations onto a

///     <c>CreateAsync</c> factory methods.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     These extensions exist so that <c>CreateAsync</c> and one or more <c>AddAsync</c> calls can
///     be written as a single expression without intermediate variables:
///     <code>
/// await using var scope = await TransformFileScope
///     .CreateAsync(file, _ => "v1")
///     .AddAsync(c => c + "-patched");
///     </code>
///     Without them, the caller would need to <c>await</c> <c>CreateAsync</c> into a local and then
///     <c>await AddAsync</c> separately.
